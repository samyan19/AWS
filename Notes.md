# Notes

Every offering in Amazon's cloud is a service.

AWS stands for Amazon Web Service.

These services are broken down into components that we can use to mix and match our needs.

RDS stands for Relational Database Service.

Cloud companies allow you to consume compute resources much like you do with an electric company.

The word cloud is used as a metaphor for the internet.

Servers, storage and compute resources are delivered through the internet.

Each AWS region is a separate geographic location.

Data centers are called Availability Zones.

All these Availability Zones are isolated from one another.

RDS automatically backups up your databases.
